## Find the best defensive team per season



## Find best offensive team per season

## Graph on how the total defensive attributes (Rebounds, steals, TO, etc) are compared to other teams
## This will answer our hypothesis of being a defensice team makes you win the championship
## If hypothesis is correct, graph other attributes
## If hypothesis is incorrect, look for other clues on what makes a champion
