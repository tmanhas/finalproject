Our final project is based on NBA games, mainly focused on every game played between the time period 2014-2018.
Through the data extraction in this project, a lot of statistics will reveal important aspects of the game play of individual teams. The main questions that will be answered through our project are:
-Which team plays the best defensively and offensively?
-What are the overall statistics for each team from season to season?

This is being done by a way of assigning a certain amount of points to each team dependent on the amount of team goals, 3 pointer shots, Free throws., Off Rebounds, Assists, Turnovers, and total number of fouls.
